                Booking tours with funasiago.com, you will not only experience a new way to have your holidays all in
                your
                way but also enjoy one of the most competitive and transparent pricing structure on the current
                marketplaces. That is what makes us different. <br/><br/>Designed with circular routes as we call them
                the tour-lines which can flexibly be whole or partially combined into one trip. Each tour line has
                multiple places enroute where you can choose to join in the tour or drop off from it. This feature gives
                tour participants a freedom to decide on how many days to go on tour, which part of the available tour
                lines you want to join in or which places from the recommended lists of local attractions you want to
                discover, or even what local tastes and flavours you wish to try, and many more at your own choice for a
                holiday trip. This also means you can tailor your tour to fully match your style, interests and your
                time
                or plan, be it a short escape or an extended adventure or a strange land discovery. All is by your
                choice
                and under our care. <br/><br/>For all that, you only have to pay an highly competitive fixed day tour
                price year-round and the number of days you actually are on tours -  no more, no less.
